How to Prescribe Metformin- Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose by decreasing hepatic glucose production and intestinal absorption, and improving insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin does not modify insulin secretion, though fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease with treatment Metformin acts on glycogen synthetase and stimulates the intracellular synthesis of glycogen. Metformin increases the transport capacity of all types of glucose membrane transporters
